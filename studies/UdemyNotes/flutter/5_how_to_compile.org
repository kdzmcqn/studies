* How Flutter/Dart 'transformed' to a Native App?

* Flutter does NOT use Platform Primitive

** Flutter
    ** RaiseButton()
        *** iOS UIButton
        *** Android widget.Button

    * RaiseButton()
        ** Custom implementation
            /Flutter directly controls every pixes which is drawn/
            Greater control, less platform-limitations/no *translation loss*
